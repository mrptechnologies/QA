Usually, we will act on your request within sixty (60) calendar days after we receive your request.  Within that time, we will either provide the accounting of disclosures to you or give you a written statement of when we will provide the accounting and why the delay is necessary.<br><br>


There is no charge for the first accounting we provide to you in any twelve (12) month period.  For additional accountings, we may charge you for the cost of providing the list.  If there will be a charge, we will notify you of the cost involved and give you an opportunity to withdraw or modify your request to avoid or reduce the fee.
